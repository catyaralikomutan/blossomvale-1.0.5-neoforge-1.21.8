## 1. Overview / Genel

This Terms of Use file describes how BlossomVale may be used, redistributed, credited, and what liabilities the author disclaims. Code is licensed under the included `LICENSE` (MIT). Non-code assets bundled with releases (textures, icons, sounds, models, etc.) are licensed under `ASSETS-LICENSE.md` (recommended: CC‑BY‑4.0). See those files for full legal texts.

Bu belge, BlossomVale modunun kullanım, yeniden dağıtım ve atıf kurallarını ile yazarın sorumluluk reddini açıklar. Kod için `LICENSE` (MIT) dosyasına, varlıklar için `ASSETS-LICENSE.md` dosyasına bakınız.

---

## 2. Attribution / Atıf (Lütfen Uyun)

When distributing the mod, including it in a modpack, or showing it in public media (videos/streams), please include one of the following attribution lines:

- Distribution / Modpack / Web pages:
  "BlossomVale — by Cat_YaraliKomutan (https://github.com/catyaralikomutan) — Assets CC‑BY‑4.0, Code MIT."

- Video / Stream description (YouTube preferred tag):
  "Mod: BlossomVale by Cat_YaraliKomutan — https://github.com/catyaralikomutan — Please credit the author and tag https://www.youtube.com/@Cat_YaraliKomutan"

- In‑game / credits:
  "BlossomVale — created by Cat_YaraliKomutan"

Varlıkları değiştirdiyseniz, değişiklikleri belirtin (ör. "Modified from original by [your name]"). CC‑BY‑4.0 şartlarına uyunuz.

Note: Requesting a YouTube tag is a preferred/standard attribution request — include the channel link above in video descriptions or tags where possible. Requiring social-media tagging as a strict legal condition is difficult to enforce; still, please respect and follow this attribution in practice.

## 3. Permissions & Restrictions / İzinler ve Sınırlamalar

- Code: Licensed under MIT (`LICENSE`) — you may use, modify, distribute, and include in commercial works provided the original copyright and license notice remain.
- Assets: Licensed as described in `ASSETS-LICENSE.md` (recommended CC‑BY‑4.0) — attribution is required.
- If you want to use this mod or its assets in a commercial product or paid bundle, please contact the author for written permission at the GitHub Issues link below or via other contact methods.

---

## 4. Liability & Warranty Disclaimer / Sorumluluk ve Garanti Reddi

- The mod is provided "AS IS" with no warranties. The author is not liable for any damages, data loss, server issues, performance problems, or other losses arising from use of the mod.
- Users install and run the mod at their own risk.
- This disclaimer is consistent with the MIT license terms included in `LICENSE`.

---

## 5. Malicious or Illegal Use / Kötüye Kullanım

- Any illegal, malicious, or rule-violating use of this mod (cheating, harming servers/players, distributing malware, etc.) is the sole responsibility of the user performing that action.
- The author expressly disclaims responsibility for misuse. If misuse or harm is reported, the author may request removal of the mod from the offending distribution or contact relevant platform maintainers.

---

## 6. Enforcement & Takedown / İhlal ve Kaldırma Süreci

If license terms or attribution requirements are violated:

1. The author will attempt to notify the distributor/pack maintainer and request correction.
2. If unresolved, the author may file takedown or DMCA/licensing reports with the hosting platform (GitHub, Modrinth, CurseForge, YouTube, etc.) or pursue other legal remedies.

Please contact the author first to resolve issues amicably.

## 8. Changes / Değişiklikler

This Terms of Use may be updated. Check the repository root for the latest `TERMS_OF_USE.md` before redistributing. Continued distribution after updates implies acceptance of the updated terms.

---

## 9. File naming & capitalization / Dosya isimleri ve büyük harf kullanımı

- Place this file at the repository root as `TERMS_OF_USE.md` (uppercase with underscores) — GitHub and users commonly recognize this.
- Keep the license file named `LICENSE` (all caps) in the repo root.
- Internal headings may use Title Case for readability; capitalization in headings does not change legal meaning.

## 10. Legal note / Hukuki not

I am not a lawyer. This document is practical guidance to make attribution, liability, and enforcement expectations clear. For binding legal advice or a custom enforceable agreement (for example, to require mandatory social‑media tagging as a legal condition), consult a qualified attorney.
